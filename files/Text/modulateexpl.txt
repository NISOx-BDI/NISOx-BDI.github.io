An  additional  step  can  be introduced to compensate for the effect of
spatial  normalisation.  When  warping  a  series  of  images to match a
template,   it   is  inevitable  that  volumetric  differences  will  be
introduced  into  the  warped  images.  For  example,  if  one subject's
temporal  lobe  has  half  the  volume of that of the template, then its
volume  will  be  doubled  during  spatial normalisation. This will also
result  in  a  doubling  of  the voxels labeled grey matter. In order to
remove  this  confound,  the  spatially normalised grey matter (or other
tissue  class)  is adjusted by multiplying by its relative volume before
and  after  warping. If warping results in a region doubling its volume,
then  the  correction will halve the intensity of the tissue label. This
whole  procedure  has  the effect of preserving the total amount of grey
matter signal in the normalised partitions.
 
A   deformation  field  is  a  vector  field,  where  three  values  are
associated  with  each  location  in  the  field.  The  field  maps from
co-ordinates  in  the  normalised  image  back  to  co-ordinates  in the
original  image.  The  value  of the field at co-ordinate [x y z] in the
normalised  space  will  be  the  co-ordinate [x' y' z'] in the original
volume.  The  gradient  of the deformation field at a co-ordinate is its
Jacobian matrix, and it consists of a 3x3 matrix:
   /                      \
   | dx'/dx  dx'/dy dx'/dz |
   |                       |
   | dy'/dx  dy'/dy dy'/dz |
   |                       |
   | dz'/dx  dz'/dy dz'/dz |
   \                      /
 
The  value of dx'/dy is a measure of how much x' changes if y is changed
by a tiny amount.
 
The  determinant  of  the Jacobian is the measure of relative volumes of
warped  and  unwarped  structures.  The  modulation step simply involves
multiplying by the relative volumes.
