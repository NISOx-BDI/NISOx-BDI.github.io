           List Mode Movie (542KB MPEG)</a> </p>

        <p>This is an estimate of the dynamic distribution of [15]-O labeled water, after the injection of a 5 milliCurie bolus. This axial slice passes through the cerebellum and the inferior temporal poles; it captures the early, transient passage of activity through the internal carotid artery (petrous part), as well as the build up of tracer in cerebellar and brain tissue. </p>

        <p>Relative to usual conventions the image is upsidedown, posterior at the top of the image, anterior at the bottom. </p>

           Full volume List Mode Movie (139KB MPEG)</a> </p>

        <p>This is the same data as above, but now all slices of the brain have been reconstructed and we use a different visualization method. We view the subject from the side and set him rotating; the blue colored region indicates the outline of the head. In red we see the spatiotemporal distribution of the [15]-O-water tracer in the carotid artery and, subsequently, throughout the brain. </p>

        <p>This movie represents approximately 20 seconds in real time. </p>

           Raclopride list mode movie (2MB MPEG)</a> </p>

        <p>This is an estimate of the dynamic distribution of [11]-C Raclopride, a dopamine ligand. Note how initially the distribution is nearly uniform throughout the brain, while subsequently the tracer only collects in the striatum. </p>

        <p>This movie represents 90 minutes of data; note the slow shifting of the head to the left and right indicating subject motion. </p>

        <p>Relative to usual conventions the image is upsidedown, posterior at the top of the image, anterior at the bottom. </p>
