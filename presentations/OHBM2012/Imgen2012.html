<h3>Description</h3>
This course will introduce the fundamentals of "Imaging Genetics," the process of modeling and understanding genetic variation in brain image data. The course begins with a four-lecture genetics tutorial in the morning, designed to give imaging practitioners a quick overview of key genetics concepts and terminology. The remainder of the course covers how imagers can use genetic variables in their analyses. Specific topics include voxel-wise genome-wide models, joint multivariate modeling of imaging and genetic data, and heritability analyses of cortical surface and thickness data. The course concludes with two case studies highlighting current imaging genetics research.
