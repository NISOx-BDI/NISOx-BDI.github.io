<h3>Description</h3>
Despite the surge in graphical modeling for functional and structural brain imaging data, often researchers only consider one method and just a pair of competing network models. The purpose of this workshop is to educate neuroimaging users about the "Network of Network Methods" that exists, and show the relationships between the different methods used in imaging and in other disciplines. We also will discuss how to choose the appropriate method for the data and the question at hand, and how to search large space of models that can be fit to your data.
