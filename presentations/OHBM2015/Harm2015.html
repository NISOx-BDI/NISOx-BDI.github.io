<h3>Description</h3>
<h4> About the meeting </h4> The volume of neuroimaging data produced is increasing steadily, as are explicit "big data" projects, where 100's or 1000's of subjects are studied and shared with the community. Even for small studies, it is increasingly required that the imaging data are shared. However the value of this quantity of data will be limited if a constellation of different methodologies are used in its preparation. For many aspects of brain imaging, the imaging and analysis techniques have matured so that best-practice options are easily identifiable.<br><h4> Meeting Purpose </h4> The purpose of the workshop is to bring together experts methodologists and leaders of neuroimaging studies large and small to discuss ways to harmonize practice. From image acquisition sequence, to quality control methods, to statistical analyses, NIMH is seeking ways to maximize the utility of shared resources. It is seeking input on how to publicize the existing tools that could be embraced to minimize site-to-site variability, and to identify shortcomings in existing tools that make it more difficult for users to produce high quality and comparable neuroimaging results. A series of short presentations will be followed by a lengthy discussion from all participants.
