<h3>Description</h3>
This course will introduce the fundamentals of "Imaging Genetics," the process of modeling and understanding how genetic variation influences the structure and function of the human brain as measured through brain imaging. The course begins with a lecture on the fundamentals of genetics, including the types of variation observed in the human, the mechanism by which that variation develops, and understanding how to relate genetic variation to a measured phenotype. We will then delve more into applications of genetics to neuroimaging phenotypes with an overview of imaging phenotypes. We will provide the student with modern tools to perform associations to both common and rare variation, conduct imputation and meta-analysis, and interpret significant findings. Overall this course will provide the neuroimager who is not familiar with genetics techniques both theoretical and practical understanding of the genetics field when exploring neuroimaging phenotypes.
