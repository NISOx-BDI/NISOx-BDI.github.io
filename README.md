# NISOx website

Website of the NISOx research group at the Oxford Big Data Institute based on [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) and [Github-pages](https://pages.github.com/) and [Pybtex][] to generate the publication list. 

Preview is available at: https://nisox-bdi.github.io/.

## How to get a local copy?
Because we are using a submodule, the repository has to be cloned with the recursive option:
```
git clone --recursive git@github.com:NISOx-BDI/NISOx-BDI.github.io.git
```

To run the website locally, you will also need to install the dependencies: [Python](https://www.python.org/), [Pybtex](https://pybtex.org/) (`pip install pybtex`), [Jinja2](http://jinja.pocoo.org/docs/2.10/) (`pip install jinja2`) and [Jekyll](https://github.com/jekyll/jekyll) (`gem install jekyll`).

## How to update the website?
Except for the page including the publication list (cf. [below](#how-to-update-the-publication-list))  and the presentation pages (cf. [section 'How to update the presentations pages?'](#How to update the presentations pages?)), any new change pushed to the `master` branch of the current repository will automatically be reflected on the website. It is stronly advised to preview the changes locally before pushing to GitHub (cf. [section 'building'](#building)).

## How to update the publication list?
Every time the `bib/pubs.bib` file is updated, the corresponding HTML page (located in `_includes/pubs.html`) has to be updated with:
```
make
```

Note that `bib/pubs.bib` cannot contain any non-ASCII character or `make` will fail. To identify non-ASCII character in a document, you can use on Mac `pcregrep --color='auto' -n "[\x80-\xFF]" bib/test.bib ` (cf. [this post](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/24939813/recursively-search-in-files-for-a-range-of-unicode-characters)).

## How to update the presentations pages?
Every time one of the `_data/conferences.yml`, `_data/courses.yml`, `_data/posters.bib` or `_data/talks.bib` files are updated, the corresponding HTML pages (located in `presentations`) have to be updated with:
```
make
```

## How to update the Research pages?
Every time one of the `_data/research.bib` or `_data/resPages.yml` files are updated, the corresponding HTML pages (located in `Research`) have to be updated with:
```
make
```
Alternatively, if research pages have been entered manually, so long as the `_data/resPages.yml` file has been updated correctly, these should be automatically displayed when the site is next run. 

## Notes

Note that none of the YAML and bib files cannot contain any non-ASCII character or `make` will fail. To identify non-ASCII character in a document, you can use on Mac `pcregrep --color='auto' -n "[\x80-\xFF]" <write filename here> ` (cf. [this post](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/24939813/recursively-search-in-files-for-a-range-of-unicode-characters)).

To remove any pages generated by running `make`, run `make clean`. Do this before pushing to GitHub.

### Features
* Thanks to [Jekyll][], content is just text files. So even faculty should be able to figure it out.
* Publications list generated from BibTeX.
* Personnel list. Organize your professors, students, staff, and alumni.
* Combined news stream and blog posts.
* Easily extensible navigation bar.
* Responsive (mobile-ready) design based on [Bootstrap][].

### Publication List

The list of publications is in `bib/pubs.bib`. Typing `make` will generate `pubs.html`, which contains a pretty, sorted HTML-formatted list of papers. The public page, `publications.html`, also has a link to download the original BibTeX.

### Presentation Pages

To add new presentations to the website update the `_data/conferences.yml` (if a new conference needs to be added - e.g. OHBM2018), `_data/courses.yml` (if a new course needs to be added - e.g. OHBM 2018 Introduction to imaging genetics), `_data/posters.bib` (if a new poster needs to be added) or `_data/talks.bib` (if new talks need to be added) files. Full instructions of how to do this can be found in the comments at the top of each of these files. 

### Research Pages

To add a new research page to the website there are two options. Either create one manually in the research folder by creating a file named `Research/{desired page name}/index.html` or create one by adding publications to `_data/Research.bib`. In either case the `resPages.yml` file must be updated so that links to the new page are added to the main research page. Further detail of how to do this can be found in the comments at the top of each of these files.

### News Items and Blog Posts

For both long-form blog posts and short news updates, we use Jekyll's blogging system. To post a new item of either type, you create a file in the `_posts` directory using the naming convention `YYYY-MM-DD-title-for-url.md`. The date part of the filename always matters; the title part is currently only used for full blog posts (but is still required for news updates).

The file must begin with [YAML front matter][yfm]. For news updates, use this:

    ---
    layout: post
    shortnews: true
    ---

For full blog posts, use this format:

    ---
    layout: post
    title:  "Some Great Title Here"
    ---

And concoct a page title for your post. The body of the post goes after the `---` in either case.

### Personnel

People are listed in a [YAML][] file in `_data/people.yml`. You can list the name, link, bio, and role of each person. Roles (e.g., "Faculty", "Staff", and "Students") are defined in `_config.yml`.

### Building

The requirements for building the site are:

* Python 2.7: many of the following modules were built on python 2.7 and thus no guarentee is made that the website can run on later python versions.
* [Jekyll][]: run `gem install jekyll`
* [Pybtex][]: run `pip install pybtex`
* [bibble][]: included as a submodule. Because git is cruel, you need to use
  `git clone --recursive URL` or issue the commands `git submodule init ; git
  submodule update` to check out the dependency.
* ssh and rsync, only if you want to deploy directly.

`make` compiles the bibliography and the website content to the `_site`
directory. 

To preview the site, run: 
```
jekyll serve -w
``` 
and head to http://0.0.0.0:4000.
