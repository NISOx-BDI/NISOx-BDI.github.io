  <div class="feature"> 
   <p>False Discovery Rate (FDR) is a new approach to the multiple comparisons problem. Instead of controlling the chance of <em>any</em> false positives (as Bonferroni or random field methods do), FDR controls the expected <em>proportion</em> of false positives among suprathreshold voxels. A FDR threshold is determined from the observed p-value distribution, and hence is adaptive to the amount of signal in your data. </p> 
   <p>FDR is more sensitive than traditional methods simply because it is using a more lenient metric for false positives. However, if there is truly no signal anywhere in the brain, a FDR-controlling method has the same control as standard methods. That is, if the null hypothesis is true everywhere, a FDR procedure will control the chance of a false positive anywhere in the brain at the specified level. (In technical terms, FDR methods have weak control of Familywise Type I error; for more on the standard Familywise approach, see Nichols &amp; Hayasaka, <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/14599004">Controlling the Familywise Error Rate in Functional Neuroimaging: A Comparative Review</a>, Stat. Meth. in Med. Research, 12(5): 419-446, 2003.) </p> 
   <p>Below is software, in the form of an extension to SPM, and an article introducing FDR to the neuroimaging community. Please feel free to <a href="mailto:thomas.nichols@bdi.ox.ac.uk">contact me</a> with any questions. </p>

   <h2>Software: FDR inference in Matlab </h2> 
   <hr> 
   <p>The following function will supply p-value thresholds which control the expected FDR at a specified rate. </p> 
   <menu> 
    <li><a href="../../files/Matlab/FDR/FDR.m"><tt>FDR.m</tt></a>&nbsp;<br> This function takes a vector of p-values and a FDR rate. It returns two p-value thresholds, one based on an assumption of independence or positive dependence, and one that makes no assumptions about how the tests are correlated. For imaging data, an assumption of positive dependence is reasonable, so it should be OK to use the first (more sensitive) threshold. <p>Here is one example of how to use this function with a T image.<br> <br> </p> <pre> 
      Timg     = % read t image, with df degrees of freedom
      Timg(~isfinite(Timg(:))) = [];
 
      P        = 1-cdf('T',Timg(:),df);
 
      [pID pN] = FDR(P,0.05);
 
      tID      = icdf('T',1-pID,df)     % T threshold, indep or pos. correl.
      tN       = icdf('T',1-pN,df)      % T threshold, no correl. assumptions
      </pre> </li> 
   </menu> 
   <br> 
   <br> 
   <h2>Software: FDR for multiple images </h2> 
   <hr> 
   <p>Use this Matlab function, <a href="../../files/Matlab/FDR/multFDR.m"><tt>multFDR.m</tt></a>, to find a common FDR threshold for a set of images. It will return a single common t threshold as well as a set of individual t thresholds for comparison. </p> 
   <p>It requires SPM99 or SPM2, but can be used with any Analyze-format <em>T</em> image. </p> 
   <p><br> <br> </p> 
   <h2>Software: Illustrating the FDR threshold </h2> 
   <hr> 
   <p>Use this Matlab function, <a href="../../files/Matlab/FDR/FDRill.m"><tt>FDRill.m</tt></a>, to evaluate an image's t distribution and observe the PP-plot graph that determines the FDR threshold. </p> 
   <p>It requires SPM99 or SPM2, but can be used with any Analyze-format <em>T</em> image. </p> 
   <p><br> <br> </p> 
   <h2>Software: Extending SPM99 for FDR inference</h2> 
   <hr> 
   <p><em>(Note: SPM2 already includes FDR, so no patches are needed.) </em> </p> 
   <p><a href="http://www.fil.ion.ucl.ac.uk/spm">SPM</a> provides corrected p-values based on Familywise (Type I) Error control; a Familywise Error (FWE) is one or more false positive anywhere in the brain. The following new and modified SPM m-files will add a column of FDR-corrected p-values to SPM output and allow for the specification of FDR-corrected thresholds. Otherwise it does not alter SPM's behavior<sup>*</sup>. </p> 
   <p>The compressed tar file below contains the 11 m-files needed to implement FDR within SPM. The files will expand into a separate <tt>spm_fdr</tt> directory. Include this directory before your spm99 directory, e.g. </p>

	path('/my/path/spm_fdr',path)

    <li><a href="../../files/Matlab/FDR/spmucFDR.m"><tt>spm_uc_FDR.m</tt></a>&nbsp;<br> This new function is the core of the FDR calculations. Based on a statistic image, it finds the FDR threshold for a given q; q is the upper bound on the expected FDR, and can be thought of as 'alpha'. </li> 
    <li><a href="../../files/Matlab/FDR/spmPFDR.m"><tt>spm_P_FDR.m</tt></a><br> This new function provides the inversion of spm_uc_FDR, providing a p-value for a given statistic value. Note, since FDR is based on the empirical distribution of the p-values, the natural "corrected p-values" are not necessarily monotonic; monotonicity is enforced, but sometimes this results in odd p-values (e.g. there might be many voxels with different statistic values that share the same p-value). <p>&nbsp;</p> </li> 
    <li><a href="../../files/Matlab/FDR/spmlist.m"><tt>spm_list.m</tt></a><br> This SPM function required the most substantial changes, as it generates the tabular output of statistic values and corrected and uncorrected p-values. There is now an additional column for FDR-corrected p-values, and the footer now reflects the FDR of the threshold and an upper bound on expected number of false positives (among the suprathreshold voxels, conditional on the number of suprathreshold voxels). </li> 
    <li><a href="../../files/Matlab/FDR/spmVOI.m"><tt>spm_VOI.m</tt></a><br> This function required minor changes to pass on information about the mask used. </li> 
    <li><a href="../../files/Matlab/FDR/spmgetSPM.m"><tt>spm_getSPM.m</tt></a><br> This function required minor changes to pass on information about the (mapped) statistic image and the mask used. Also, it now asks for what type of corrected p-value (FWE or FDR) instead of just yes-no. <p>&nbsp;</p> </li>

These functions are not specifically FDR-related, but the FDR code assumes the presence of these updated files. </li> 
   </menu> See this 
   <a href="../../files/text/betacore.txt">note</a> on a bug fix to Matlab core function 
   <tt>betainc</tt>/
   <tt>betacore.</tt> The symptom is that SPM hangs when it's determing FDR p-values. 
   <p><sup>*</sup>This tar file includes new modifications to SPM that were released June 28, 2001, in the form of the last six functions listed above. These modifications modify the (FWE) corrected p-value procedures to always take the minimum of random field and Bonferroni results. As released, SPM99 only gives random field p-values and thresholds even if Bonferroni results are more powerful. This is a minor change will, at most, reduce corrected p-values and thresholds in certain situations (typically, low degrees of freedom analyses). </p>

   <p>Note on the preprint: The preprint reflected the current results at the time of submission. Since then, the independence FDR result of 1995 (BH 1995; in the above paper, "c(V)=1" on pg 9) has been shown to be more general (BY 2001). In particular, a technical condition known as <em>positive regression dependency</em> is sufficient to use the 1995 result. Examples of this condition include multivariate normal data where the covariance matrix has all positive elements; this seems a reasonable assumption for imaging, and hence the code above uses the c(V)=1 result. </p>
