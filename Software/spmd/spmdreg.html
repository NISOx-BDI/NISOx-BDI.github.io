<p>To keep and maintain resources to support SPMd we need to know something about the demographics of SPMd user base, in terms of location, modality, and previous SPMd usage. Therefore, prior to downloading SPMd software, please complete the following registration form: </p>

<ul>
  <li>Please supply at least your name, institution and location. </li>
  <li>This information is for demographic purposes only.<br>
     No individual details will be released. </li>
  <li>Your <em>e</em>mail address (if supplied) will not be added to any list or publicly accessible file. <br>
     <em>(The <a href="http://www.fil.ion.ucl.ac.uk/spm/help">SPM email discussion list</a> will remain the forum for discussions and announcements regarding SPMd.)</em><br>
     Only in exceptional circumstances will we contact you directly regarding the software you are about to download. </li>
  <li>It would be helpful for us if you could indicate the imaging modalities you use, how many people will use the software you are downloading, and which (if any) versions of the SPMd software you have previously used. </li>
  <li>Any additional comments will be <em>e</em>mailed directly to the SPMd authors. </li>
  <li>Posting the form will take you to a page giving you the URL's for downloading the requested SPMd software. </li>

</ul>
