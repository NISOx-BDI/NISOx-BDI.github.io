  <p> The SwE toolbox for longitudinal and repeated measures neuroimaging data uses a marginal model with the sandwich estimator of standard errors. It is implemented as a Matlab toolbox for SPM8 or SPM12.

  <h4>What's new?</h4> 
  <ul> 
   <li>As of September 2015, better small sample adjustments have been added as well as the Wild Bootstrap to make non-parametric inferences with the Sandwich Estimator. </li> 
   <li>(A paper covering these new developments is in preparations; please see Dr. Guillaume's thesis for full details.)</li> 
  </ul> 
  <h4>Why use SwE?</h4> This approach has a number of advantages over traditional linear mixed effect models: 
  <ul> 
   <li><b>Easy random effects</b><br> Only the population model is specified, meaning that no random effects (e.g. random slopes) need to be specified. 
    <ul> 
     <li>Despite having no explicit specification, <em>all</em> possible random effects are accounted for through the use of an unstructured error covariance.</li> 
     <li>For moderate sample sizes, the "Hom"ogeneous sandwich estimator assumes each subject in a group shares the same visit-based covariance strucutre.</li> 
     <li>For large sample sizes, the "Het"ergoeneous (tranditional) sandwhich estimator doesn't even assume common covariance over subjects.</li> 
     <li>When comparing multiple groups, each group automatically has its own covariance structure.</li> 
    </ul> </li> 
   <li><b>No convergence problems</b><br> The population model is estimated with Ordinary Least Squares, meaning that the method is non-iterative and thus is immune to convergence failures not uncommon in complex mixed effects models.</li> 
   <li><b>Built for neuroimaging</b> 
    <ul> 
     <li>Toolbox for widely used SPM software</li> 
     <li>While the traditional sandwich estimator techniques often assume large samples, SwE implements carefully evaluated (and in some cases novel) degrees of freedom estimator and small sample adjustments.</li> 
     <li>Familywise error-corrected voxel and cluster inferences are available with the Wild Boostrap, avoiding any parametric (e.g. random field theory) distributional assumptions.</li> 
    </ul> </li> 
  </ul>
