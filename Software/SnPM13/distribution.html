<p><strong>Quick link! Download is available on <a href="snpmreg">Registration page</a></strong></p>

<p>The software is available for download, but we ask you to first complete a brief <a href="snpmreg">registration form</a> prior to downloading. Having completed the form, you will receive an email with a URL for SnPM13 (and previous versions). You should also periodically check the <a href="snpm13updates">SnPM13 updates</a>, and replace older files shipped in the standard distribution. </p>

<h2><a name="help">Support</a></h2>

<p>SnPM is being made freely available to the functional Neuroimaging community in the same spirit as SPM. As with SPM, SnPM may be considered academic shareware. It is supplied as is, and no formal support or maintenance is provided or implied. </p>

<p><strong>Please email the authors <a href="mailto:snpm-support@googlegroups.com">snpm-support at googlegroups.com</a> </strong>with SnPM issues and idiosyncrasies, but also please CC the <a href="http://www.fil.ion.ucl.ac.uk/spm/help/">SPM <em>e</em>mail discussion list</a>, at &lt;<a href="mailto:spm@jiscmail.ac.uk">spm@jiscmail.ac.uk</a>&gt; so other SPM users can learn from the questions. </p>

<!--<p>For any issues the SnPM authors may be contacted at &lt;<a href="mailto:snpm-support at googlegroups.com">snpm-support at googlegroups.com</a>&gt;. In particular suggestions for improvement are welcome, particularly those substantiated with code! <!- -Requests for specific design PlugIns will be considered, but necessarily as invitations for collaborative work.-->
<h2><a name="updates13">SnPM13: Updates</a></h2>

<p><strong>Updated versions of appropriate SnPM functions are available from the <a href="snpm13_updates">snpm13_updates page</a></strong>. A <code>README</code> file provided with the updates describes the bugs that have been reported, along with the appropriate fixes. </p>

<!-- <p>None found yet!</p> -->
<!--<p>Installation is relatively straightforward. Download the gzipped tar file and unzip it in a location where you want the snpm3 directory. Then, add the full pathname of this directory to your MATLABPATH. (You can check this by typing <code>which spm</code> in MatLab and examining the path, or try <code>spm ver</code>.) </p>-->
<!--<p>Please report bugs to &lt;<a href="mailto:snpm-support at googlegroups.com.">snpm-support at googlegroups.com.</a>&gt;. Peculiarities and general queries should also be raised on the <a href="http://www.fil.ion.ucl.ac.uk/spm/help/">SPM <em>e</em>mail discussion list</a>. We will report patches to the list and make updates available if necessary. -->

<h2><a name="help">Requirements</a></h2>

<p>The SnPM toolbox is a small suite of MatLab functions and M-files that integrate with <a href="http://www.fil.ion.ucl.ac.uk/spm/">SPM</a> routines. Thus, to use SnPM13 you must have installed SPM8 or SPM12b, to use SnPM8 you must have installed SPM8, to use SnPM5 you must have already installed SPM5, and to use SnPM3 you must have already installed SPM2. See the <a href="http://www.fil.ion.ucl.ac.uk/spm/distrib.html">SPM distribution page</a> for SPM hardware &amp; software requirements, downloading &amp; installation instructions, and conditions of distribution. You should be familiar with SPM before using SnPM. </p>

<p>For step by step instructions on downloading and installing SPM distributions, refer to the <a href="http://www.fil.ion.ucl.ac.uk/spm/distrib.html# Download">SPM distribution page</a>. </p>

<ul>
  <li>SnPM8b <!-- - released 7<sup>th</sup> July 2010:  This was the first SnPM toolbox for SPM8. While it has been tested in-house, we have received limited feedback from external users and so it is still considered a beta release. SnPM8b has all the features of SnPM5, but is compatible with SPM8. Currently SnPM8b uses the sequential type interface of SPM2. We are working to make it use the same hierarchical job manager as SPM8. -->
