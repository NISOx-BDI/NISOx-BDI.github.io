<h2><a name="help">Support</a></h2>

<p>SnPM is being made freely available to the functional Neuroimaging community in the same spirit as SPM. As with SPM, SnPM may be considered academic shareware. It is supplied as is, and no formal support or maintenance is provided or implied. </p>

<p><strong>Please email the authors <a href="mailto:snpm-support@googlegroups.com">snpm-support at googlegroups.com</a> </strong>with SnPM issues and idiosyncrasies.</p>


<h2><a name="help">Requirements</a></h2>

<p>The SnPM toolbox is a small suite of MatLab functions and M-files that integrate with <a href="http://www.fil.ion.ucl.ac.uk/spm/">SPM</a> routines. Thus, to use SnPM13 you must have installed SPM8 or SPM12b, to use SnPM8 you must have installed SPM8, to use SnPM5 you must have already installed SPM5, and to use SnPM3 you must have already installed SPM2. See the <a href="http://www.fil.ion.ucl.ac.uk/spm/distrib.html">SPM distribution page</a> for SPM hardware &amp; software requirements, downloading &amp; installation instructions, and conditions of distribution. You should be familiar with SPM before using SnPM. </p>

<h2><a name="update">Updates</a></h2>

<p>To check for updates, open <code>SnPM</code> and type <code>SnPM_update</code>. This function will tell you whether your current version of <code>SnPM</code> is up to date and where to download a newer version if not. (Note: This function requires an internet connection).</p>
