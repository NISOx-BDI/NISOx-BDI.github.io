<h3>Description</h3>
The neuroimaging network paradigm has gained a lot of traction in recent years as a framework for understanding cognition. However the existing tools such as correlation matrices, graph analysis methods and time-varying connectivity have bumped into their limits. Consequently the network paradigm is a very long way from achieving its potential. In particular, currently, there are no mature answers to basic questions of: biomarker development; reliable individual network construction (crucial for the development of imaging based personalised medicine); construction and validity of time-varying networks and relating information across modalities. Thus now is a perfect moment time to present to junior scholars, a selection of major emerging techniques that go beyond the current limits. In each case a domain expert will explain the basics of the new methods, illustrate with preliminary results and outline challenges for the future.
