Working as an information analyst for a year in the National Health Service Scotland inspired her to do a DPhil in Statistics with application in public health. In particular, Petya is interested in Bayesian statistics and Genetics which led to her dissertation being focussed on identifying an appropriate model for correlated data suitable for data generated from experiments to study DNA methylation.</p>

Furthermore, he worked on fitting Probabilistic Index Models on very large datasets. Currently, he is a PhD student at the department of Data Analysis at Ghent University. As his interests grew towards methodological research in neuroscience, he now focusses on meta-analytical models and procedures in fMRI data analysis. He tries to incorporate his findings and recommendations in a broader framework of reproducibility and reliability of neuroscience.</p>
