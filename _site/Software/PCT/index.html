<h1>Percent Change Threshold<HR></h1>

The Percent Change Threshold (PCT) is a way to characterize the
variability and sensitivity of functional neuroimaging data.  PCT is
the minimum significant percent change for an effect of interest, and
is just a scalar multiple of the coefficient of variation (standard
deviation divided by mean).  While its definition is trivial,
constructing PCT images from linear models requires carefully scaled
predictors and contrasts.<P>

Below there is code (as an add-in to SPM99) for creating PCT images
and a draft describing the use of PCT images.  The gzipped-tar file
will create a PCT directory; if you place this in your spm99/toolbox
directory, you should get a PCT option on the toolbox plugin.<P>

Please send <a href="mailto:nichols@umich.edu">me</a> feedback on the
paper and the software.<P>

<font color="red">Important:</font> If you downloaded the PCT software
before December 19th, please get the current version.  An error was
causing most contrasts (those expressing differences) to have PCT
images with 1/2 the correct intensity.<P>  

(More documentation soon!)<P>

The above tech report relied heavily on a modified
<tt>spm_orthviews</tt>, as given <a href="#download">above</a>.  A brief overview of the
features are given here.  To use, just make sure that the PCT
directory is in your matlab search path before spm99, and then just
use 'Display', 'CheckReg' or 'Results->Overlays->Sections' as usual.

<menu>
  <li>Image name.<BR> The image name is now displayed atop the 3-views.<P>
  <li>Current voxel value.<BR>  In the lower right of the 3-view display
      is shown the value of the current voxel.<P>
  <li>Easy colorbars.<BR>  To add color bars, just type
      <tt>spm_orthviews('addcolorbar')</tt> (Note American spelling :)<P>
  <li>Easy windowing of colorbars.<BR>  Once you have added colorbars
      to your orthogonal viewer, you can right click on the color bar
      to change the intensity window.  To pick a value to be the new
      maximal intensity, put the cursor over that intensity, right
      click, and then select 'Set max'; same for 'Set min'.  You can
      also type a value manually ('Manual'). You can also 
      set the same intensity window set for all views by using the
      lower set of menu options.<P>

      (Note that this will not work with the hot-metal colorbar seen
      in the results window overlay sections orthoview.  This colorbar
      isn't placed by spm_orthviews and hence doesn't have this
      dynamic windowing option).<P>
      
  <li>Crosshair gap.<BR> In order to better see the current voxel the
      cross hairs do not meet at an  "X".  You can change
      the magnitude of the gap with
      <tt>spm_orthviews('xhairsgap',p)</tt>, where p is the gap size
      in fraction of the crosshair (default is 0.05).<P>
  <li>Viewing Maximum Intensity Projections (MIPs)<BR> Instead of
      orthogonal slices, you can view a MIP of an image.  Bring up
      whatever images you like and then use the command
      <tt>spm_orthviews('mipify',hdl)</tt>, where hdl is the image
      number.  It will take a moment, but you will have the MIP of the
      image instead of slices. (Of course, clicking around on a MIP is
      quicker than clicking around orthogonal slices, since the image
      data only needs to be loaded once).  To go back to the normal
      viewer just issue the mipify command again.<P>

      Note, unlike the MIP's in the results window, this shows you the
      MIP of <em>everything</em>, not just the voxels that survived
      the various intensity and cluster thresholds.<P> 
  <li>Dual colorbar labeling.<BR>You can add a second scale to an
      existing colorbar with the
      command <tt>spm_orthviews('colorbar2',hdl,x)</tt>, where hdl is
      the image number (1 if using 'Display', or the image number in English
      reading order if using 'CheckReg') and x is the scale
      factor. You will then get two values displayed in the lower
      right, the lower value corresponding to the second scale.<P>

      This is <em>very</em> useful for PCT.  Say you create a PCT for
      uncorrected alpha=0.05 (threshold, say, 1.96), and you happen to
      know that your corrected threshold (Bonferroni/FDR/RFT,
      whatever) is, say, 4.2.  You add a colorbar which will show you 
      the uncorrected PCT.  To get a corrected color axis you just
      need to know what the ratio between the corrected and
      uncorrected threshold.  Here the ratio (the value x above) 
      would be 4.2/1.96 = 2.14.<P>
