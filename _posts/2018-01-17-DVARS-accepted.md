<i> Insight and Inference on DVARS </i>has been accepted for a recent issue of Neuroimage! <!--more-->
This work, authored by <a href="mailto:soroosh.afyouni@bdi.ox.ac.uk">Soroosh Afyouni</a> and <a href="mailto:thomas.nichols@bdi.ox.ac.uk">Tom Nichols</a>, proposes an inference method for the seminal work of <a href="https://www.jstor.org/stable/2235765?seq=1#page_scan_tab_contents">John Von Neuman on mean square of successive differences (MSSD)</a>. 
<br><br>In terms of neuroimaging applications, this work is a continuation of <a href="http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1053811911011815?via%3Dihub"> the popular "scrubbing" method</a> via producing p-values for spikes in DVARS. This work also shows the MSSD merely explains "fast" variabilities in 4D data-sets. However, when combined with two other components, slow and edge variabilities, it can delivers a summary of spatio-temporal corruptions (i.e. head movement, physiological signals and cerebral blood circulations).
