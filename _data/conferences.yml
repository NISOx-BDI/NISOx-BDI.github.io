# This YAML file contains all data for conferences listed on the NISOx website. Data written in this file takes 
# the following fields:
#
# - name: (Mandatory) A machine readable name which will be used to create the URL for this conferences page. This is also used
#         to determine which conference data in the talks.yml, courses.yml and posters.yml belong to.
#
# - displayname: (Mandatory) This is the name that will be used when referring to this conference in the text of the website.
#
# - descrip: (Optional) This is a description of the conference. If not filled in, sections where it would normally be displayed
#            will appear blank.
#
# - sections: (Mandatory) This consists of 3 boolean variables (talks, courses and posters) referring to whether or not there is
#             corresponding data for this conference in the talks.yml, courses.yml and posters.yml files respectively. (I.e. are 
#             there any talks stored from this conference? Are there any courses? Are there any posters?)
#
# - format: (Mandatory if there are posters stored for this conference) This consists of one boolean variable, posterDaysAvailable,
#           which tells us if there is information about which day/stand posters were presented on/at at this conference. (I.e. if
#           posters.yml has code and day data stored for posters for this conference, posterDaysAvailable should be true).
#
# Notes: Fieldnames are case sensitive and entries with colons, question marks or obscure unicode charactors may error.
#        To include colons and question marks in field entries, wrap said field entries in speech marks - "".
