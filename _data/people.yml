        Soroosh Afyouni is a PhD student at the Institute of Digital Healthcare at the University of Warwick. He is supervised by Professor Thomas Nichols and Professor Theodoros Aravanitis in collaboration with Dr. Andrew Bagshaw at the University of Birmingham. Soroosh is currently working on resting-state functional connectivity of the human brain and its graph theoretical modelling. He graduated in electronic engineering from University of Birmingham in 2012. His MEng dissertation was on Bloch-equation based simulation of spin-echo sequences in magnetic resonance imaging.

        Simon Schwab is a Visiting Fellow in Neuroimaging Statistics with Prof. Thomas Nichols at Oxford University, funded for the duration of 12 months by the Swiss National Science Foundation (SNSF). He is currently working on a new method of effective connectivity and its validation using functional MRI data from the Human Connectome Project and the UK Biobank. Before joining the University of Oxford, he worked with Tom Nichols at Warwick University and before that as a Postdoctoral Fellow at the Psychiatric Neuroimaging Unit at the University Hospital of Psychiatry in Bern, Switzerland. He received his Ph.D. in neuroscience (2013) and his M.Sc. in psychology and computer science (2008) from the University of Bern.

        Petya comes from Bulgaria where she attended the National High School of Mathematics and Natural Sciences. In 2011, Petya moved to Scotland to study at the University of Glasgow and in 2016 she successfully graduated Integrated Masters programme in Statistics with a year in industry. Working as an information analyst for a year in the National Health Service Scotland inspired her to do a DPhil in Statistics with application in public health. In particular, Petya is interested in Bayesian statistics and Genetics which led to her dissertation being focussed on identifying an appropriate model for correlated data suitable for data generated from experiments to study DNA methylation.

        Sam Davenport is a PhD student at the University of Oxford on the OxWaSP Program, supervised by Thomas Nichols and Chris Holmes. Sam is currently working on Selective Inference methods to correct for bias in fMRI that arising due to the Winner's Curse. He is also looking at methods for dealing with Missing Data. He did his undergraduate in Mathematics at Cambridge before going on to do the Part III mathematics masters course there specialising in Statistics. His masters dissertation was entitled "Statistical Analysis in Neuroimaging Structural Breaks" which involved identifying changes in the brain using bootstrapping techniques and looking at multiple hypothesis testing in tree structures.

        Alex Bowring is a DPhil in Population Health student based in the Big Data Institute at the University of Oxford. His research is centred on functional MRI, with a particular focus on statistical methodology for neuroimaging analyses and developing open science practices. He is currently applying newly developed statistical methods to obtain precise confidence statements about where activation occurs in the brain for population neuroimaging studies, where thousands of subjects have been scanned. As well as this, he is also working on a software comparison project to understand the differences between the main neuroimaging software packages used for fMRI analyses.
