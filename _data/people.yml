        Alex Bowring is a research assistant in the Institute of Digital Healthcare at the University of Warwick. His primary role is to assist Camille Maumet and Thomas Nichols in developing standard practices for data sharing and meta-analysis in neuroimaging as part of the project "Transforming Statistical Methodology for Neuroimaging Meta-Analysis”. Additionally he is also applying newly developed statistical methods to obtain precise confidence statements about where activaiton occurs in the brain. In 2015 Alex completed his BSc. in Mathematics from the University of Warwick. In summer 2015 he undertook a project entitled “Visualising the brain - Developing viewers of standardised fMRI results”.
