    The neuroimaging network paradigm has gained a lot of traction in recent years as a framework for understanding cognition. However the existing tools such as correlation matrices, graph analysis methods and time-varying connectivity have bumped into their limits. Consequently the network paradigm is a very long way from achieving its potential. In particular, currently, there are no mature answers to basic questions of: biomarker development; reliable individual network construction (crucial for the development of imaging based personalised medicine); construction and validity of time-varying networks and relating information across modalities. Thus now is a perfect moment time to present to junior scholars, a selection of major emerging techniques that go beyond the current limits. In each case a domain expert will explain the basics of the new methods, illustrate with preliminary results and outline challenges for the future.

    <h4> About the meeting </h4> The volume of neuroimaging data produced is increasing steadily, as are explicit "big data" projects, where 100's or 1000's of subjects are studied and shared with the community. Even for small studies, it is increasingly required that the imaging data are shared. However the value of this quantity of data will be limited if a constellation of different methodologies are used in its preparation. For many aspects of brain imaging, the imaging and analysis techniques have matured so that best-practice options are easily identifiable.<br><h4> Meeting Purpose </h4> The purpose of the workshop is to bring together experts methodologists and leaders of neuroimaging studies large and small to discuss ways to harmonize practice. From image acquisition sequence, to quality control methods, to statistical analyses, NIMH is seeking ways to maximize the utility of shared resources. It is seeking input on how to publicize the existing tools that could be embraced to minimize site-to-site variability, and to identify shortcomings in existing tools that make it more difficult for users to produce high quality and comparable neuroimaging results. A series of short presentations will be followed by a lengthy discussion from all participants.

    This course will introduce the fundamentals of "Imaging Genetics," the process of modeling and understanding how genetic variation influences the structure and function of the human brain as measured through brain imaging. The course begins with a lecture on the fundamentals of genetics, including the types of variation observed in the human, the mechanism by which that variation develops, and understanding how to relate genetic variation to a measured phenotype. We will then delve more into applications of genetics to neuroimaging phenotypes with an overview of imaging phenotypes. We will provide the student with modern tools to perform associations to both common and rare variation, conduct imputation and meta-analysis, and interpret significant findings. Overall this course will provide the neuroimager who is not familiar with genetics techniques both theoretical and practical understanding of the genetics field when exploring neuroimaging phenotypes.

  descrip: |
    Functional neuroimaging has provided a wealth of information on the cerebral localization of mental functions. In spite of its success, however, several limitations restrict the amount of knowledge that may be gained from each individual experiment. These include a usually rather small sample size, limited reliability of an indirect signal like BOLD fMRI and the need to base inference on relative contrasts between conditions. Such limitations have raised some concerns on the interpretability and validity neuroimaging results, but have also encouraged the development of quantitative meta-analysis approaches. Neuroimaging meta-analysis is used to summarize a vast amount of research findings across a large number of participants and diverse experimental settings. Such integration then enables statistically valid generalizations on the neural basis of psychological processes in health and disease. They also permit comparisons of different tasks or processes to each other and the modeling of interacting networks. Quantitative meta-analysis therefore represents a powerful tool to gain a synoptic view of distributed neuroimaging findings in an objective and impartial fashion, addressing some of the limitations raised above. The purpose of this course is to review the theory and practice of meta-analytic modeling and database-driven syntheses. In order to provide a comprehensive overview, this course spans both basic and advanced topics and addresses practical tips and tools to conduct meta-analytic studies in psychological and clinical applications. This broad coverage will thus provide both a deeper understanding of the methodological underpinnings as well as concrete ideas for how to apply meta-analytic techniques to advance brain science.

    While the explosive growth of neuroimaging over the last 20 years is now a commonplace, less remarked is the similar growth of neuroimaging data analysis methodology. Indeed since the beginning of the HBM conference about 20% of the posters have been on methodology demonstrating emphatically the enduring importance of methodology. Further the intense recent interest in connectivity has put pressure on the methodology to deal coherently with the complementary information supplied by different modalities such as MEG, EEG, DTI and so on. But how to do this for those who lack the expertise without handing all responsibility to the 'quants'? This course will tackle that challenge from a number of angles. But an underlying theme will be a bottoom-up approach that starts with realistic neuroimaging data and allows the issues to thereby emerge naturally. But even though the whole neuroimaging community of necessity uses methods, only a fraction are experts. Yet rigorous science requires the scientisit to be critical of all aspects of the science and this includes methodology.

  Organizedby: |

  descrip: |
    A typical fMRI study is a massive endevour: 100's of man-hours to prepare paradigms and train subjects; costly scanner time; and laborious data analysis to process gigabytes of image data. Yet the crucial result of a study is a list of x,y,z atlas coordinates of activation, a dataset that can be recorded on a Post-it note. Indeed, this coordinate list is the only information incorporated into a typical meta-analysis. Given the vital importance of these x,y,z coordinates, why are they never reported with confidence intervals? Wouldn't we expect some tasks to produce activation with greater spatial variability than others types of tasks? The problem is that, until very recently, there simply were no methods to quantify the uncertainty in the spatial location of activations. <br><br> The purpose of this workshop was to review the emerging work in the explicit spatial modeling of neuroimaging data. Thomas Nichols provided a short overview, itemizing the limitations of standard mass univariate models and reviewing the potential of spatial models. Alexis Roche discussed a model selection approach to fMRI that uses a hierarchical spatial generative model, resulting in inference on a network of regions while accounting for uncertainty in location. Timothy Johnson presented point process model for metaanalysis and multiple sclerosis lesion data; in addition to be more interpretable, this model provide superior classification performance relative to univariate (naive bayes) methods. Finaly, Sam Gershman showed how cognitive scientists are using spatial models with fMRI, with work that uses latent topographic sources to decode semantic representations during a memory task.

    Despite the surge in graphical modeling for functional and structural brain imaging data, often researchers only consider one method and just a pair of competing network models. The purpose of this workshop is to educate neuroimaging users about the "Network of Network Methods" that exists, and show the relationships between the different methods used in imaging and in other disciplines. We also will discuss how to choose the appropriate method for the data and the question at hand, and how to search large space of models that can be fit to your data.
