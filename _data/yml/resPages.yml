# This YAML file contains all data for research sections listed on the NISOx website. Data written in this file takes 
# the following fields:
#
# - name: (Mandatory) A machine readable name which will be used to create the URL for this conferences page. This is also used
#         to determine which conference data in the talks.bib, courses.yml and posters.bib belong to.
#
# - displayname: (Mandatory) This is the name that will be used when referring to this conference in the text of the website.
#
# - regenerate: (Mandatory) If this page is generated by the resGen.py script using data in research.bib, then set this to be True. If
#               alternatively, you have manualy created a html file for this page (e.g. like the "GuideFor" page) set this to be False.
#               IMPORTANT: Any page with regenerate set to be True will automatically be deleted by cleanupscript.py when "make clean" 
#               is run! Make sure you don't get this field wrong else you could delete manually entered pages!!!
#
# - pretext: (Optional) Text displayed above the presentations list in a script-created page.
#
# - posttext: (Optional) Text displayed below the presentations list in a script-created page. 
#
# Notes: Fieldnames are case sensitive and entries with colons, question marks or obscure unicode charactors may error.
#        To include colons and question marks in field entries, wrap said field entries in speech marks - "".

    <h4> Lectures on Spatial Point Processes </h4> In September 2010 as part of a <a href = "https://www2.warwick.ac.uk/fac/sci/statistics/crism">CRiSM</a> lecture series, Dr. Tim Johnson of the University of Michigan Biostatistics gave a set of three lectures on point processes, with practical details on how to build Bayesian models and samplers for these types of data. Lecuture notes for all three lectures are here: <a href="../../files/PDF/JohnsonSpatialPointProc.pdf">PDF</a>
